				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoy.tv/category/sri-chinmoy/sri-chinmoy-sport/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> often gave as much significance to the outer life as he did to the inner. A lifelong sportsman he found numerous ways to inspire his students to transcend their perceived limitations in athletics. In so doing he knew that if they set challenging goals for themselves it would also inspire them to make inner progress as well. In the late 70s he took up the sport of distance running with intense dedication. <span id="more-480"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The running boom was just taking off in America and Sri Chinmoy, at age 47, when most would think of retiring, trained himself to run the most difficult distance of all, the marathon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On March 3 1979, he completed his first Marathon in Chico California. His time was 4:31 and just 3 weeks later he would run one again. Now on this 30th anniversary of that event, his students honor him by running the 26 mile distance. They do this not just in Jamaica Queens where he lived, but in centers around the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">All his life Sri Chinmoy was a very keen and active sportsman; on the one side to stay fit and on the other side to be a good example for all his students, as his philosophy includes physical fitness as part of his spiritual path. During the August Birthday Celebrations in 1991, Sri Chinmoy used a free moment to throw the javelin on his tennis ground area in Queens, New York. Watch the master in another disciple as we usually know him.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sri Chinmoy's 203lb Wrist Curl]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">On the 20th of October, 2005, at the age of 74, Sri Chinmoy broke his own record by curling a 203 lb dumbbell ten times with both his right and left wrist.  Sri Chinmoy undertook lifts such as these to illustrate the possi- bilities of physical and spiritual self-transcendence, even in our advancing years.<span id="more-389"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Chinmoy states: “<em>You may wonder why I do such stupid things at the ripe old age of 74! My Inner Pilot, God, is my Inspiration. He is my Aspiration. He is my protector. I give Him all the credit</em>.” Asked about his message to others, Sri Chinmoy says, “Never give up! Never give up! Physical fitness is of paramount importance. There is no age limit when we live in the heart and when we try to be of prayerful and soulful service to God in the heart of humanity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dumbbell is so heavy that it takes two adult assistants just to place the weight on a cradle which is then lowered near Sri Chinmoy’s quadriceps. After the cradle is completely separated and far out of the way, he curls the entire weight with only his wrist muscles. Because the weight is so heavy, Sri Chinmoy feels that he taking a great risk with the 200 pound dumbbell. In the future, he will practise on a regular basis with 170 lbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim Smith, long-time Registrar of the British Amateur Weigh Lifters Association and an expert on lifting heavy weights exclaimed: “I am certain that nobody else in the world can do a wrist curl with a 200 pound dumbbell—no matter how old they are or how much they weigh! The strongest men in the world are seeing that a septuagenarian is curling with one arm much more than twice the weight that the world’s best body builders and weightlifters can curl with two arms.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five time Mr. Universe Bill Pearl and holder of the “Best Built Man of the 20th Century” title stated: In my more than 60 years in the fitness and bodybuilding field I have never heard of anyone in the world able to curl this huge amount of weight! This is a miracle to me!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bodybuilding’s top magazine, Muscle and Fitness, awarded Sri Chinmoy the second greatest feat of strength for any human being in the past year—lifting 200,873 pounds of weight in one evening at a New York event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“The word impossible is only in the mind and not in the heart.”</em><br />
<em>- Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Chinmoy went on to lift a <strong><span style="color: #993300;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoy.tv/435/sri-chinmoys-256lb-wrist-curl/"><span style="color: #993300;">256lb Wrist Curl</span></a></span></strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Excerpt from a 2004 interview]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From 1985 until his passing in 2007, Sri Chinmoy became intensely involved in the world of weightlifting, performing many remarkable weightlifting feats as well as honouring countless people for their services to humanity by raising them overhead using a specially designed apparatus, lifting them up in body and spirit. Naturally, people are curious to know why a spiritual Master would enter into such an unconventional activity: In this 2004 interview, Sri Chinmoy explains how his weightlifting serves the world by giving people joy &#8211; &#8220;we are here on earth to give joy to each other&#8221;.<span id="more-4244"></span></p>
