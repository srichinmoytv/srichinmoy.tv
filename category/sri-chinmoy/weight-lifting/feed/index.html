				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a part of his &#8220;Lifting up the World with a Oneness-Heart&#8221; program, Sri Chinmoy lifted overhead the A.C. Milan football team, including not only the players but also the medical and other staff present. <span id="more-7023"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Thank you. It was a big a big pleasure for us. I want to say thank you for everything you are doing for the world, for peace.&#8221; </em><br />
<em>- Leonardo Nascimento, Vice President A.C. Milan and Brazilian Champion, (unofficial transcript)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart&#8221; Program is a unique award that was offered by Sri Chinmoy to recognise individuals from all walks of life who had inspired and uplifted humanity. Sri Chinmoy lifted the recipients overhead either with one arm or both arms using a specially constructed platform in a symbolic gesture of oneness with their uplifting achievements. Speaking of his lifting programme, Sri Chinmoy said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am trying with my capacity to encourage and inspire people in various walks of life who have inspired others in sports, literature, science or politics, or in their own personal lives. I lift them up to show my appreciation for their achievements,”</p></blockquote>
<p>Beginning in June 1988, Sri Chinmoy honoured more than 8,300 individuals in this manner, including Heads of State, diplomats, spiritual and religious leaders of many faiths, distinguished achievers in the arts and in literature, Nobel laureates and world class athletes.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Only by our positive thinking,</em><br />
<em> By our bringing the positive qualities</em><br />
<em> Of others to the fore,</em><br />
<em> Will this world be able</em><br />
<em> To make progress.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>~Sri Chinmoy &#8211; <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.org/service/lifting_up_the_world">Lifting up the World with a Oneness-Heart</a><br />

		<description><![CDATA[TV footage from 1986 with Sri Chinmoy lifting a baby elephant and interview.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In this video clip, we see TV footage  from 1986 of Sri Chinmoy lifting an elephant. Sri Chinmoy is also interviewed by a TV presenter, and he explains his motivation for doing this kind of lift. <span id="more-5756"></span>Question: What do you hope to show by this?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: &#8220;First of all, I would like to make it very clear to you that I am not a body builder, I am not a weightlifter. But, I am a truth seeker and God lover. For about thirteen months, my inner pilot, God, has been telling me to be of inspiration to the world of strength. That is to say, not to neglect the body, one has to accept the body as something most important in our life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sri Chinmoy</em> &#8220;Only to inspire people that we can get strength in our physical from the spiritual. From meditation and concentration we can get power, and this power can be executed in the physical as well. We can use the inner strength for the outer life as well.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sri Chinmoy's 203lb Wrist Curl]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">On the 20th of October, 2005, at the age of 74, Sri Chinmoy broke his own record by curling a 203 lb dumbbell ten times with both his right and left wrist.  Sri Chinmoy undertook lifts such as these to illustrate the possi- bilities of physical and spiritual self-transcendence, even in our advancing years.<span id="more-389"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Chinmoy states: “<em>You may wonder why I do such stupid things at the ripe old age of 74! My Inner Pilot, God, is my Inspiration. He is my Aspiration. He is my protector. I give Him all the credit</em>.” Asked about his message to others, Sri Chinmoy says, “Never give up! Never give up! Physical fitness is of paramount importance. There is no age limit when we live in the heart and when we try to be of prayerful and soulful service to God in the heart of humanity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dumbbell is so heavy that it takes two adult assistants just to place the weight on a cradle which is then lowered near Sri Chinmoy’s quadriceps. After the cradle is completely separated and far out of the way, he curls the entire weight with only his wrist muscles. Because the weight is so heavy, Sri Chinmoy feels that he taking a great risk with the 200 pound dumbbell. In the future, he will practise on a regular basis with 170 lbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim Smith, long-time Registrar of the British Amateur Weigh Lifters Association and an expert on lifting heavy weights exclaimed: “I am certain that nobody else in the world can do a wrist curl with a 200 pound dumbbell—no matter how old they are or how much they weigh! The strongest men in the world are seeing that a septuagenarian is curling with one arm much more than twice the weight that the world’s best body builders and weightlifters can curl with two arms.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five time Mr. Universe Bill Pearl and holder of the “Best Built Man of the 20th Century” title stated: In my more than 60 years in the fitness and bodybuilding field I have never heard of anyone in the world able to curl this huge amount of weight! This is a miracle to me!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bodybuilding’s top magazine, Muscle and Fitness, awarded Sri Chinmoy the second greatest feat of strength for any human being in the past year—lifting 200,873 pounds of weight in one evening at a New York event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“The word impossible is only in the mind and not in the heart.”</em><br />
<em>- Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sri Chinmoy went on to lift a <strong><span style="color: #993300;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoy.tv/435/sri-chinmoys-256lb-wrist-curl/"><span style="color: #993300;">256lb Wrist Curl</span></a></span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From 1985 until his passing in 2007, Sri Chinmoy became intensely involved in the world of weightlifting, performing many remarkable weightlifting feats as well as honouring countless people for their services to humanity by raising them overhead using a specially designed apparatus, lifting them up in body and spirit. Naturally, people are curious to know why a spiritual Master would enter into such an unconventional activity: In this 2004 interview, Sri Chinmoy explains how his weightlifting serves the world by giving people joy &#8211; &#8220;we are here on earth to give joy to each other&#8221;.<span id="more-4244"></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1985, at the age of 54, Sri Chinmoy took up weightlifting. Over the ensuing years his achievements went from strength to strength. He believed that &#8216;age was in the heart, and not in the mind&#8217; and right up until his passing in October 2007 at the age of 76 he was set personal bests in a number of lifts, with some of the lifts totalling thousands of pounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Challenging Impossibility</em>debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2011. Directed by Sanjay Rawal and Natabara Rollosson, the film features bodybuilding legends Bill Pearl, Frank Zane, Mike Katz and Dan Lurie, world champion strongman Hugo Girard, and nine-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis relating their experiences of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s lifting. We also see footage of Sri Chinmoy honouring Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Sting and Susan Sarandon as part of his Lifting Up the World with a Oneness Heart award.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sri Chinmoy's Weightlifting Celebration 1998]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1998 there was a very significant weight-lifting anniversary in New York. Sri Chinmoy displayed many incredible feats, such as lifting a group of singers on a platform, a group of men in a mountain formation, 145 pounds overhead in each arm simultaneously, weights on his stomach, and much more. This video clip shows the highlights of that function. By the way, after a short intermission Sri Chinmoy changed into his Indian garments and gave a beautiful concert the same evening!</p>
