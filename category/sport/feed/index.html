<div class="js-clip_description description">
<p class="first" style="text-align: justify;">In August 2014 the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team organized its 27th Marathon Swim covering the whole length of the Lake Zurich in Switzerland. 40 solo swimmers and 21 teams from all over the world started early in the morning in Rapperswil with the goal to reach Zurich within 12 hours by swimming nonstop on the Lake Zurich. In the beginning the sky was cloudy, but around noon the sun came to the fore and the air temperature climbed up to 27°C. Around Meilen the lake was choppy, the water temperature was ca. 21- 22° C. First to reach Zurich was Marco Allegretti from Italy in 6 h 19 m 41s. He beat the record of Jürg Schmid (CH) in the category “Men without wetsuit” from 2008. Fastest in the women’s category was Rachael Lee from Ireland with 7h 02m 15s. In the category “Relays with wetsuit” the team “Young, fast and furious” from Switzerland placed first in 6h 59m 11s. “Young and fast” the three girls are indeed, being only 12, 13 and 14 years of age!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sept 2010: 4 Guinness World Records set in Munich, Germany]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 participants from 7 countries set 4 Guinness World Records, 11 world records and 4 personal records as part of the 17th “Impossibility Challenger” organised by the Sri Chinmoy Centres in Dachau, near Munich, Germany. <span id="more-2965"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the records were:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>58-year-old <strong>Khiv Raj Gurjar</strong> from Jodhpur in India, did 41 yoga asanas and stretching exercises in 5 minutes 19 seconds and 31 poses in 4 minutes 5 seconds balancing on a BMX Bike without touching the ground, and also balances for 11 minutes 18 seconds on a BMX Bike without contact with the ground.</li>
<li>By juggling with 3 axes 53 times 51-year-old <strong>Milan Roskopf</strong> from Bratislava (Slovakia) improved his old world record by 18 times.</li>
<li>36-year-old <strong>Anavi Davies</strong> from Canada entertained the ears of her listeners and witnesses as she set a new Guinness World Record with her whistling marathon, whistling songs of Sri Chinmoy, the founder of the Impossibility Challenger, for 24 hours. Indian born Sri Chinmoy composed over 21,000 songs during his lifetime.</li>
<li>The 18-year-old German <strong>Christian Schaefer</strong> tore 36 regular size envelopes in 30 seconds (old record: 26), blew a stamp with his mouth over a 100 metre long course in 3 minutes and 4 seconds – 4 minutes and 25 seconds faster than his predecessor &#8211; and memorized 207 binary numbers (old record 132) in one minute. That makes an astonishing total of 3 entries in the Guinness Book of World Records for the North German Memory Champion of 2010.</li>
<li><strong>Ranjit Pal</strong> (48) from Phagwara in India set a world record in his age category with the most rope skips in one minute. He did more than 4 rope skips in one second &#8211; a total of unbelievable 276.</li>
<li><strong>Rainer Schroeder</strong> from Altenburg near Leipzig in Germany  set a world record by bending a 44 cm long and 1 cm thick bar of construction steel from straight to 39 degrees with bare hands at his neck. The 49-year-old broke also a 3 mm steel chain by stretching his body in 5 seconds. The steel chain was wound around his waist and on the other end fixed at a steel plate on which he stood, a second world record for Schroeder.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Chinmoy (1931 -2007) initiated the Impossibility Challenger in 1982 to inspire people to experience the joy which comes from transcending one&#8217;s own capacities capacities. Sri Chinmoy himself set many weightlifting world records and transcended them with increasing age.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Camera &amp; Edit: Parimal P. Repka</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Note: The activities in this clip are carried out by highly skilled people who have trained very carefully for this event; some would be dangerous without the necessary skill or additional protection. We hope you find this report inspiring, but please do not try any dangerous activities at home.</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[July 2011: The 42nd solo crossing for the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">On 11 July 2011, Abhejali Bernardova from Czech Republic swum the English Channel in a time of 14 hours and 37 minutes. Abhejali is the 27th member of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team to complete the crossing and the 42nd solo swim overall &#8211; the record for the most Channel crossings by any team.<span id="more-2632"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abhejali was assisted by support crew Jayalata Dadkovicova, Ritadyumna Tobolkova, Lenka Svecova, Jana Bernardova (Abhejali&#8217;s sister) from Czech Republic and Dhavala Stott from Scotland, on the Seafarer II boat piloted by Chris Osmond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously, Abhejali was part of an SCMT international relay team that swum the Channel in 2009 in a 4-person team which included Vasanti Niemz from Germany, who was the first member of the SCMT to swim the Channel in 1985.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Watch the sprint training in Queens, NY in 1991]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a period in Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s life where he practiced sprinting with a lot of intensity and dedication. First he practiced on the local streets of Queens, New York. Later he trained on a secluded track behind the tennis court area (which today is known as &#8220;Aspiration-Ground&#8221;). Watch and enjoy some of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s sprinting activities of 1991, when he was 60 years-old.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Footage from a race in April 2012.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Every week, a 2 mile race is held in many Sri Chinmoy Centres around the world as a fun way for people to get together and challenge their capacities. This footage is taken from the April 14, 2012 race in New York, which featured many of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students from around the world who were present for our annual April gathering.<span id="more-4163"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Chinmoy was a frequent visitor to the Saturday morning race in New York, often spontaneously composing a race prayer or song at the conclusion of the race. These were later compiled into a 2-volume series called <em>My Race-Prayers</em>. At the conclusion of the race, one of the prayer-poems that he composed for the race is read out.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Lots of smiles and joy at the USA Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team's newest race.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, the Self-Transcendence Swim-Run was introduced last year. It differs markedly from the non-profit team’s current repertoire of ultra-distance races, in that it offers non-extreme athletes an opportunity to challenge and transcend themselves as well.</p>
<p>The Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team has been organising races in the New York area since 1977, and are specialists in endurance races such as the Self-Transcendence Six and Ten Day Race, and the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race, the world&#8217;s longest road race. “It’s exciting because the event is something new in our menu,” says Race Director Rupantar LaRusso. “It’s a unique event in that there is a lot of volunteer support…and good food afterwards.”</p>
<p>The driving force behind the event, however&#8211;Sri Chinmoy’s message of oneness, peace, and self-transcendence—remains unchanged. The inspirational quotation from Sri Chinmoy’s writings at this year’s race was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I swim in the silence-sea,<br />
I see the blossoming of my heart’s illumination-sun.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next year the race is scheduled to be held on Sunday, September 11, once again at Lake Welch Beach, Harriman State Park. For upcoming information please visit <a href="http://us.srichinmoyraces.org/">us.srichinmoyraces.org</a>. It promises to be another inspiring end-of-season opportunity at an idyllic venue!</p>
